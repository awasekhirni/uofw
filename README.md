# Record of the work @University of Waterloo (Volunteer without pay)

Awase Khirni Syed awase008@gmail.com 



I volunteered with University of Waterloo. ON as a research scientist mentoring master's and Ph.D. students. I have written couple of proposals. Due to lack of funding, I have moved on to seek paid positions. I have contributed to some research papers which are currently under review, as an when they are published, i shall include them in the github repo here.
Please find copy of my work, research publications and proposals for the following projects. Please find supporting documents to my contribution uploaded at this URL http://github.com/awasekhirni/uofw

Proposals written: I have written 3 proposals. Unfortunately, there is no funding. 
1. #Multi-scale dynamic human mobility flow patterns for spatio-temporal epidemiology modelling.
    
    #modules: 
      a. stakeholder engagement and system mapping- to foster dialogue and coproduction of the programme of research
      and generate a early warning system of outbreaks and their geographic spread. identify key challenges, desired outcomes and leverage points for potential interventions
      
      b. creating an integrated data and analytics platform - to synthesize evidence to support real-time mapping 
      identification and prioritization of interventions, and parameterisation of model to simulate the impact of various 
      diseases; curate data resources to inform and facilitate health infrastructure, climatic models that amplify the spread of disease. 
      
      c. envioning and prioritising interventions - policy and actions - to build, develop, implement and monitor health infrastructure and spatio-temporal behaviour 
      of human and animals that amplify or cease the spread of infectious disease. to define, evaluate data driven policy insights based on 
      various spatio-temporal, spatio-economical and environmental models.
      
      d. evaluation- to evaluate the impact of public policy interventions, delivered to achieve rapid remedial course corrections;
      to monitor and change health care system. to model and predict spatio-temporal human behaviours. 
      
      e. modelling - to co-develop integrated health care monitoring sytem, population health, economic and environmental models to characterize 
      various threats in advance. to model interactions with populations and environments and to simulate long-term and short-term projections,
      devise sustainbale interventions through local and national policy or business practices. 
      
      f. synthesis and impact - to synthesize findings across modules, draw conclusions and report transparently to wider public.
      to identify implication for research, policy and practice. Investigate the efficacy of various multi-channel communications to share theoretical and methodological innovations, and ensure evidence generated is used and draw metrics driven policy guidelines.
      
3. Quantification and forecasting transport sector emissions and their carbon dynamics across Canada using MODIS Terra datasets.
4. Disturbance Monitoring Platform to Enhance Forest Inventory using historical LiDAR datasets.
