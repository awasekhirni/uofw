# Record of the work @University of Waterloo (Volunteer without pay)
Awase Khirni Syed awase008@gmail.com 



I volunteered with University of Waterloo. ON as a research scientist mentoring master's and Ph.D. students. I have written couple of proposals. Due to lack of funding, I have moved on to seek paid positions. I have contributed to some research papers which are currently under review, as an when they are published, i shall include them in the github repo here.
Please find copy of my work, research publications and proposals for the following projects. Please find supporting documents to my contribution uploaded at this URL http://github.com/awasekhirni/uofw

Proposals written: I have written 3 proposals. Unfortunately, there is no funding. 
1. Multi-scale dynamic human mobility flow patterns for spatio-temporal epidemiology modelling.
2. Quantification and forecasting transport sector emissions and their carbon dynamics across Canada using MODIS Terra datasets.
3. Disturbance Monitoring Platform to Enhance Forest Inventory using historical LiDAR datasets.

Partial Work Done, could not get datasets to complete the final paper due to lack of support from University of Waterloo.
